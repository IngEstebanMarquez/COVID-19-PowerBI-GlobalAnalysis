# COVID-19-PowerBI-GlobalAnalysis
This project features a simple and functional Power BI dashboard to analyze key metrics from the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to provide a clear and concise visualization of global data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from 2020 to 2023.

## Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using publicly available datasets from Johns Hopkins University. The goal is to provide insights into the pandemic's progression over four years, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The analysis includes interactive dashboards and custom DAX measures.

## Data Sources
- **Confirmed Cases**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
- **Confirmed Deaths**: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
- **Confirmed Recoveries**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv

## Analysis Highlights
- Custom DAX measures to calculate daily new cases and total confirmed cases.
- Interactive visualizations showing trends and comparisons across countries and years.
- Relationships between datasets based on *Province/State*, *Country/Region*, and *Date*.

## Key Features
